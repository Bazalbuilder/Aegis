# Aegis (Aegis Security)
A scripting library that has many features for anti-cheat and moderation.

**This repository is in heavy development and is therefore a Work-in-Progress. Not all changes are final.**

## Installation

### Option 1: Downloading a source build
* Currently not implemented. This will become available once we implement a package manager.

### Option 2: Downloading a pre-packaged build
* Navigate to the "Releases" tab on the right side of the page and click the latest release build.
* On the "Assets" dropdown menu, click on the .rbxm file. This will prompt a download.
* Place the .rbxm file in your Studio instance.

This is the best option to utilize Aegis, as it is the most latest and stable build.

## Planned Features
Aegis is in development, so many features are not present or incomplete.

* Rate limiter
* Moderation system
* Command handler
* Player checker
* DataStore validator
* DataStore sanitizer
* Custom logger
