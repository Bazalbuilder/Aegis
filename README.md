# Aegis (Aegis Security)
A scripting library that has many features for anticheat and moderation.

**This repository is in development and is therefore a Work-in-Progress. Not all changes are final.**

## Installation

### Option 1: Downloading a source build
* TODO: add something to this soon.

This option is not recommended, as you need to manually built it yourself. It would also be considered an unstable build, so you may not get support if you create a new issue.

### Option 2: Downloading a pre-compiled build
* Navigate to the "Releases" tab on the right side of the page and click the latest release build.
* On the assets dropdown menu, click on the .rbxm file. This will prompt a download.
* Place the .rbxm file in ReplicatedStorage.

This is the best option to utilize Aegis, as it is already pre-compiled, and it would be stable.
