# Aegis (Aegis Security)
A scripting library that has many features for anti-cheat and moderation.

**This repository is in heavy development and is therefore a Work-in-Progress. Not all changes are final.**

## Installation

### Option 1: Downloading a source build
* To Be Added.

This option is not recommended, as you need to manually build the source code yourself. It would also be considered an unstable build, so you may not get support.

### Option 2: Downloading a pre-compiled build
* Navigate to the "Releases" tab on the right side of the page and click the latest release build.
* On the "Assets" dropdown menu, click on the .rbxm file. This will prompt a download.
* Place the .rbxm file in your Studio instance.

This is the best option to utilize Aegis, as it is already pre-compiled, and it would be stable.
